#  Every if statement must have an else statement
#  Never nest if statements more than 2 deep. Try not to go more than 1 deep.
#  Treat if statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set if sentences.


#  For training, these rules are more important than they are in real life. If you think a rule is dumb, and something else will work, break the rule.
